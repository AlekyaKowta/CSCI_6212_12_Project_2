# CSCI_6212_12_Project_2
Analyzing the time complexity of Staircase Problem

This repository contains the code and analysis for computing the Pareto-optimal staircase of a set of 2D points under various time complexities.

The project is structured into two parts:

Java Code: Performs the experimental timing and derives the scaling constants.

Python Code: Visualizes the experimental data against the scaled theoretical curves.

1. Java Implementation (StaircaseAlgorithms.java)
   This file contains the core logic for the experiment. It defines the point structure and implements three distinct algorithms for computing the staircase, with complexities O(n
   2
   ), O(nlogn), and O(n).

   Java Class Descriptions
   - Point:
     - A simple class representing a 2D point with x and y coordinates.
   - PointXComparator
     - A helper class used to sort points primarily by x-coordinate (ascending).
   - computeStaircase_On2
     - Implements the Brute-Force algorithm. Checks every point against every other point for domination.
   - computeStaircase_Onlogn
     - Implements the efficient Sorting + Scanning algorithm. Sorts the data first, then uses a single right-to-left scan.
   - computeStaircase_On
     - Implements the most efficient Right-to-Left Scan. This function assumes the input is already sorted by x.
   
2. Python Graph Files
   These files use matplotlib to plot the experimental data (generated by the Java program) against the scaled theoretical functions. The data used in these files is finalized and should not be modified.

- PlotGraphn.py - Plots Graph of O(n)
- PlotGraphn2.py - Plots Graph of O(n^2)
- PlotGraphnlogn.py - Plots Graph of O(nlogn)


## Running the Code

- Java:
  The Java file runs all experiments and prints the final comparison table, including the dynamically calculated scaling constants.
  1.  Compile: Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing StaircaseAlgorithms.java and compile the file:
      javac StaircaseAlgorithms.java
  2. Execute:
     java StaircaseAlgorithms

Expected Output: The console will print the derived scaling constants and a detailed table comparing the Experimental Time, Raw Theoretical Value, and Scaled Theoretical Time for O(n
2
), O(nlogn), and O(n).
